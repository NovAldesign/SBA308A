Description: This website was created for people to study using a timer. This is resembles the pomodoro timer method. People can determine their study goal and decide when to take a break. They can reset the timer or pause it depending on their needs. * A new feature that was updated was being able to listen to music while studying. I added Jamendo API to the project to allow for music to be search and listened to on the app.

Applications Used:
CSS, HTML, and Javascript

Reflection:
What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

I knew what I wanted to do with the project, but finding the right API was more difficult than I thought. I wanted to make sure that we had the type of music that would be calming. 

Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

I had to research more videos when it came to using axios to get the data from my API.

What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

I would like to have the music stop with the timer, I need to do more research to get that added. 

Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:

I think I would like to change the CSS to dark mode/light mode. I think this would help the site be even more useful to users.
